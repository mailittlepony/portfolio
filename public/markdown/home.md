## Why do I do what I do?? Here's a pretty long answer!
---

**Toward the Density of Things**

We live in an era of prediction, modeling, and generalization.
AI turns the world into probabilities.
Everything can be data.
Every behavior can be a pattern.
Every self can be a model.
Thus I propose an ontology: **the world as density**. Every object, every identity, every memory is dense — in matter, in information, in relations, and in potentiality.

Just like neural networks, I see identity as an evolving model: neither a fixed core nor a multiplicity. It is a dynamic system whose weights shift with each new input. The self becomes an architecture of memories, environments, and relationships — a dense model whose outputs may change while its underlying topology persists. Experiences move us through this latent space, yet the structure that shapes our possible selves is seeded early. **Thus human behavior, like AI behavior, arises from patterns, biases, and histories embedded in the model that constitutes us, making the human sometimes predictable.**

My work seeks to expose and question these layers: **the hidden densities of identity**, the invisible architectures of relation, and the computational metaphors that increasingly frame how we understand ourselves. Through AI and emerging technologies, **I explore the boundaries of selfhood, connection, and interpretation — inviting new ways of perceiving what we are, what we might become, and how we might exceed our own predictability.**
